# üöó AutoML Frameworks for Sustainable Fuel Efficiency Predictions

A comparative AutoML-based regression framework built to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG) using the UCI Auto MPG dataset. This project evaluates and benchmarks multiple AutoML tools including **PyCaret**, **H2O.ai AutoML**, **TPOT**, and **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, offering insights into their performance, ease of use, and predictive accuracy.

## üìä Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Predict miles per gallon (MPG) for cars based on engine and vehicle characteristics.
- Leverage automated machine learning tools to reduce model selection and tuning overhead.
- Benchmark and compare different AutoML systems for sustainable vehicle performance modeling.
